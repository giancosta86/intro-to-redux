# Introduction to Redux

_Introduction to Redux with TypeScript_

This project contains the source files of the presentation titled [Introduction to Redux](https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86/introduction-to-redux-with-typescript) - as well as a complete set of Yarn-based scripts to handle its lifecycle **and** the _sample projects_ showcasing _Redux's elegance_ combined with _TypeScript's static type checking_.

The main source file is [src/slides.md](src/slides.md), whereas the Sass-based stylesheet reside in the [src/styles](src/styles/) directory.

## Initial setup

Enter the root directory of the project and run:

> yarn

just like any other Yarn-based project.

## The build process

To build both the PDF and the HTML slides, simply run:

> yarn build

The output will reside in the different subdirectories of [dist/](dist/).

## Example projects

## Usage

Please, refer to the **scripts** section within **package.json**, then run:

```bash
yarn <script name>
```

or:

```bash
yarn test
```

to run all the tests.
