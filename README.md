# Introduction to Redux with TypeScript

_Elegant and reliable state management_

This is the companion repository to my [Introduction to Redux with TypeScript](https://speakerdeck.com/giancosta86/introduction-to-redux-with-typescript) presentation.

In particular, it contains:

- the _sample projects_ showcasing _Redux's elegance_ combined with _TypeScript's static type checking_

- the **Markdown source file** that compiles - via Marp - to the actual slides

## Usage

Please, refer to the **scripts** section within **package.json**, then run:

```bash
yarn <script name>
```

or:

```bash
yarn test
```

to run all the tests.
